# Crime-Rate-Prediction
<ul>
<li>Crime prediction and criminal identification are the major 
problems to the police department as there are 
tremendous amount of crime data that exist. There is a 
need of technology through which the case solving could 
be faster.</li>
<li>The aim of this project is to make crime prediction using 
the features present in the dataset. The dataset is 
extracted from the official sites. With the help of machine 
learning algorithm, using python as core we can predict 
the type of crime which will occur in an area. The objective 
would be to test a model for prediction.</li>
<li>Building the model will be done using better algorithm 
depending upon the accuracy. The supervised 
classification and other algorithm will be used for crime 
prediction. Visualization of dataset is done to analyse the 
crimes which may have occurred in the country. This work 
helps the law enforcement agencies to predict and detect 
crimes in India with improved accuracy and thus reduces 
the crime rate. This helps all others department to carried 
out other formalities.</li>
